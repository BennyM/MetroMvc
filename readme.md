This is an MVC example project that extends the <a href="http://code52.org/metro.css/" target="_blank">code 52 project</a>.  The code 52 team gets full
credit for everything here.  I just added a few extra styles to mesh with .NET MVC scaffolded forms and views.  Due to browser incompatibility, I removed the javascript
files from the code 52 project.  You can easily add them back in if you'd like.

.less stylesheets are compiled and minified using the <a href="http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench" target="_blank">web workbench</a> by Mindscape.
This tool is awesome and I recommend you check it out.
